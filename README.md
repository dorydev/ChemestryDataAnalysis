# Data analysis in chemestry #

This project is about data analysis in mass spectrometry.

It's coded in python in two ways:
- a jupiter notebook (for school project)
- an extern application 

There is 2 files, for subject part 1 and part 2.
All of the results have been written in the notebooks.

You can find the main subject in the folder (it's written in french btw)

I hope you enjoy my work ! ;)
